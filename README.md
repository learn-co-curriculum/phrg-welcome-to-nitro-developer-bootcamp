# Welcome to the Power Code Academy

Welcome to the PHRG Bootcamp track of the Power Code Academy! Over the next 6 months you will learn everything you need to know to get started as an Apprentice Web Developer at Power Home Remodeling Group. Before you begin, just a few thoughts about how to learn best using learn.co. It's going to be harder and more rewarding than any other learning experience you've ever had.

## Learning How to Learn

The most common misconception we get when people start the course is that we're teaching you Ruby, Javascript, HTML and CSS. Don't get me wrong, we are going to teach you those things, but that's not the most important set of things you're going to learn.

As your career as a professional developer unfolds, you're probably going to end up programming in languages that have not been invented yet. The most important thing we're going to teach you is how to learn. Using the technologies above, we'll work with you to build the skills required to read and understand error messages and search for the answers so that when you have to learn a new library, framework or language, you'll know just how to go about doing so.

## The Learn IDE

When you first start learning to code, the amount of setup you have to do to get your computer ready to really *make* something can be frustrating. To counter this, we created the Learn IDE. The Learn IDE uses a programmers text editor and provides you with a terminal window for running commands, just as you would as a professional developer. However, instead of having to configure your local computer to allow you to program, it runs your commands on a remote computer so you can jump into the programming.

## Local Development

With your new Power laptop, you are ready to say goodbye to the Learn IDE and set up your first local development environment! Having your own dev environment empowers you to not only complete this Full Stack Web Developer curriculum like a pro, it gives you the flexibility to create your own projects as we go. Let's do this!
